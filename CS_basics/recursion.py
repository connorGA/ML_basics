# Basic Principles of Recursion

    # Base Case: This is the condition under which the recursion stops. The base case prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely, ensuring the recursion terminates
    # Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself, gradually appoaching the base case. Each recursive call should progress towards the base case to avoid infinite loops
