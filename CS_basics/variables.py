# BASIC CONCEPTS

    # variables in Python are symbolic names that reference or point to data stored in memory
    # variables are dynamically typed, meaning you dont need to declare their type before using them. The type is inferred from the assigned value

# Types of Variables

    # Numeric Types: Integers('int')
    #                floating-point numbers('float')
    #                complex numbers('complex')
    # Sequence Types: Lists('list')
    #                 tuples('tuple')
    #                 strings('str')
    # Mapping Type: Dictionary('dict') - Key value pairs are invaluable for mapping feature names to their values, storing model parameters or configuration settings             
    # Boolean Type:('bool') - Represents two values, True or False
